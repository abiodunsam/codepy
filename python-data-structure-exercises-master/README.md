# List and dictionary exercises

Almost every Python program makes extensive use of lists and dictionaries.

> Make sure you understand how to use lists and dictionaries. Can you give
> three ways that lists and dictionaries are similar, and three ways that they
> are different?

This repo contains several exercises about manipulating data in lists or
dictionaries, or lists of dictionaries, or dictionaries of dictionaries...

In each exercise, there is a Python script that contains some data, and some
instructions for what to do with that data.

Before attempting each exercise, make sure that you can describe the structure
of the data in question.

You should attempt the exercises in the following order:

*  `radio_freq.py`
*  `rgb_colours.py`
*  `exam_results.py`
*  `football_results.py`
*  `bill_splitting.py`
*  `conference_schedule.py`
*  `presidents.py`
*  `browser_stats.py`

For the last two, the data is in a separate file (`presidents_data.py` and
`browser_stats_data.py` respectively).
